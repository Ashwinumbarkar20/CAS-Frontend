      "Oxy-cutting involves oxidizing metal by projecting a jet of pure oxygen combined with a pre-heat flame (oxy-gas), typically fueled by gases like acetylene or tetrene. The oxygen jet is directed onto a pre-heated area of the part, reaching fusion temperatures close to 1,300°C. Unlike other cutting methods, oxy-cutting achieves cutting through rapid oxidization rather than sheer force. Combustion occurs throughout the thickness of the cut part, with oxides formed mechanically eliminated by the cutting jet. Cutting quality is contingent upon the purity of the oxygen used.\n\nOxy-cutting is particularly suited for thick and very thick sheets of unalloyed and low-alloyed steel (> 20 mm). Its key advantages include low equipment and operational costs, capability to cut very thick parts, and enhanced productivity in multi-torch configurations. Commonly employed in shipbuilding, boiler-making, and steel frame industries, oxy-cutting remains a preferred choice for various heavy-duty applications."

Whether for complex assemblies or individual parts, Almacam Cut software is tailored to support the unique requirements of water jet technology, ensuring precision and efficiency",
    "Technology_Process": [
      "Water jet cutting is a cold cutting process that utilizes a water jet propelled at incredibly high speeds, sometimes supplemented with an abrasive additive. Initially pressurized to between 4,000 and 6,500 bars, the water is then directed through a minute diameter orifice (ranging from 0.08 to 0.4 mm). Depending on the pressure applied, the velocity of the water jet can exceed 1,200 meters per second. The impact of these water particles against the material's surface results in clean and precise cuts.\r\n\r\nFor cutting hard materials, particularly metals like steel and aluminum, an abrasive is often added to the water. This method is recommended for materials unsuitable for thermal cutting processes and for metal parts requiring preservation of their mechanical properties. Key advantages of water jet cutting include exceptionally clean cuts with no burrs, high-precision cutting accuracy within a tenth of a millimeter, minimal deformation of parts, rapid cutting speeds, and the ability to cut through very thick steel plates.\r\n\r\nThe productivity and flexibility afforded by water jet cutting enable the production of mechanical parts across small, medium, or large production runs"

    "Technology_Description": "Even with the significant expansion of laser cutting technology over the past three decades, punching-nibbling continues to be a prominent sheet metal technique, especially as machines have evolved to meet industry productivity demands. Almacam Punch software is ideally tailored for the intricacies of punching-nibbling processes. It offers a highly automated, exceptionally high-performance CAD/CAM solution capable of producing a wide range of parts as needed. Additionally, it seamlessly integrates with various types of punching-nibbling machines, combined machines, and their associated loading/unloading systems",
    "Technology_Process": [
      "Punching-nibbling involves either creating holes (punching) or cutting inner or outer profiles by executing multiple punching strokes (nibbling). This process integrates the forward movement of the sheet being cut with the vertical movement of the cutting tool. As the sheet advances beneath the press containing the tool, material is removed. Punching-nibbling is well-suited for thin sheets (up to 3 mm) and allows for material deformation such as eyes, small folds, stamped parts, and threading. While sharing a similar scope of application as laser cutting, punching-nibbling is more efficient and cost-effective for producing simple shapes and multiple holes, although it is not suitable for complex shapes. Furthermore, the ability to incorporate an unloading system enables complete automation of the manufacturing process."

      "In certain industries like aeronautics, automotive manufacturing, or armaments, thermal machining processes may risk altering material properties. Hence, parts are often machined through material removal, employing cutters to intricately shape geometric forms with precision and superior finish quality. However, this routing procedure necessitates stringent safety measures to prevent material detachment and potential accidents. Notably, parts must remain stationary as the cutter separates them from the metal sheet at the end of machining. To ensure this, some machines incorporate suction-based systems to secure the parts, while others utilize screws or rivets to affix parts and metal sheets onto a sacrificial plate, allowing for routing of multiple layered sheets. Upon completion, programmed removal of screws or rivets facilitates unloading of machined parts"
